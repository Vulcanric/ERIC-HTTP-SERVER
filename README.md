![eric web server icon](https://github.com/Vulcanric/ERIC-HTTP-SERVER/blob/main/img/eric%20webserver.png)

**eric** is a multiprocessing and a multiclient http web server, capable of interacting with web clients, receiving request, retrieving data and serving request with a response, all based on the HTTP protocol.
## The story behind
This project was envisioned as way to challenge myself (I love doing things that are bigger than me). For this, I went through days and weeks of learning the C socket API, implementing similar [projects](https://github.com/Vulcanric/Network_Programming) as practice for this web server project (Check them out [here](https://github.com/Vulcanric/Network_Programming))
